1.	How do I approach designing software?
  o	What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
     	Working on this project has greatly increased my math logic skills as they pertain to specifying positions and actions between objects.  
  o	What design process did you follow for your project work?
    	The design process I followed was to basically draw out what I wanted to happen and then work backwards to figure out the math that would lead to my desired             outcomes.
  o	How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
  	This design approach can be applied to any future project that will involve using mathematics to replicate physical movements.
    
2.	How do I approach developing programs?
  o	What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
  	Most of the development strategies I used are strategies I already had but they were just enhanced by the work on this project.  One minor new development strategy       that I came across during my work on this assignment was the strategy of rotating points within a specified plane.  
  o	How did iteration factor into your development?
  	Iteration factored into my development in two ways.  In the first way, I had to iterate through collections of objects such as:  vertices, points, shapes, and 3D         figures).  
  o	How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?
    My approach has become much more detailed, systematic and organized.  I now incorporate pictures much more into my development process as I have found that having a    visual representation of my end-goal assists me greatly in working backwards to identify the specific code commands I need to employ in order to implement the design.
    
3.	How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
  o	How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
    This was my first time learning this process, so I feel I am only scratching the surface. If I decide to learn more about computational graphics and visualizations,     I will at least have some foundations.
  o	How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway? 
  	The knowledge that I learned will be used to understand any coworkers that specialize in computational graphics and visualizations.  This course has allowed me to       have a  basic understanding to hold a conversation with someone that specializes in graphs.
